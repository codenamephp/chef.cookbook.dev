# 4.0

VSCode recipe and resources were removed. Use the codenamephp_vscode cookbook instead.

Also the whole cookbook is now depreacted an will only receive bugfixes. The resources will be moved to dedicated cookbooks. The "single package"
recipes should be implemented within wrapper cookbooks since they don't warrent dedicated cookbooks.

# 3.0

dnsmasq and resolver were removed. If you need them, just recreate the recipes in your wrapper cookoobk.
